## Getting Started

To explore the projects and code samples included in this repository, follow the installation guide below to set up the environment on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Python 3.x
- Node.js

### Installation


### Installation

This portfolio can be run with or without a container. Below are the instructions for both methods, including a note on potential issues with Windows OS and the importance of using Node.js version 16.

#### Running Without a Container

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:wlaa41/Portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Portfolio
   ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies** (Ensure Node.js version 16 is installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install --save-dev sass
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the project in your default web browser.

*Note for Windows users*: Running the project directly on Windows may lead to potential issues. It is recommended to use a container or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for a smoother experience.

#### Running With a Container

Using Docker or any compatible container platform can streamline the setup process and mitigate environment-specific issues, especially on Windows.

1. **Build the container image** (Ensure Docker is installed and running):
   ```bash
   docker build -t portfolio .
   ```

2. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 portfolio
   ```
   Access the portfolio by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

*Important*: The container version uses Node.js version 16, aligning with the project's dependencies. Ensure that any additional dependencies or environment-specific configurations are accounted for in the Dockerfile or container setup.

---

Regardless of the method chosen, `npm install --save-dev sass` is crucial for proper styling compilation. Ensure this step is not overlooked during setup.
