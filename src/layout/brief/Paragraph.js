                After my BSc degree in Electronics and Telecom in 2010, I started up a home automation business in an emerging market. Whilst enjoying being at the forefront of technology integration with day to day life, I quickly realized that my bigger goal was to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and its use cases.
                 <br  />
                 <br  />
                To that effect, I embarked on a Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence, moving to London in the process. During my Masters I enjoyed Math in particular, rediscovering the beauty of Calculus and Linear Algebra. I love explaining the concepts of Calculas and Linear Algebra and rendering thier effect.

                Some technology that I enjoy working with: TensorFlow, Unity ML Agent, Reinforcement Learning, OpenCV. Pytorch, PlotlyJS.

                I am a strong beliver of the importance of data visualization an, 3D modeling and UI/UX. I believe it is almost as important as the technical part. It manifest ideas, also it makes sharing points and knowledge easier, thus, aside from my skills in SASS and Adobe designing tools. I am currently studying ThreeJS and D3js.
