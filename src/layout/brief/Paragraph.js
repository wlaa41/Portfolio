                I have more than ten years of work experience in project management and home automation system as I worked R&D in my self-founded home automation business. I earned my BSc degree in electronic and telecom. in 2010. In 2020, I decided to pursue a bigger goal. I have started MSc degree in Artificial intelligence. During my full-time study, I enjoyed studying math in particular. I rediscovered the beauty of calculus and linear algebra. I enjoy designing 3d/2d simulator Plotly/PlotlyJS and matplotlib of equation and concepts. I am looking forward to apply what I studied in real life application

                I value descriptuion and visualization. I personally believe it is almost as important as the technical part. It manifest ideas, also it makes sharing points and knowledge easier, thus, aside from my skills in SASS and Adobe designing tools. I am currently studying ThreeJS and D3js.
