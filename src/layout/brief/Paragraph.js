                I have over 10 years of experience in home automation systems and project management after having worked in Research and Development for my self-founded home automation business. I earned a BSc degree in Electronic and Telecom in 2010 and last year I decided to pursue a bigger goal and embarked on the MSc degree in Artificial intelligence. Whilst covering numerous topics I have enjoyed studying Math in particular. I rediscovered the beauty of calculus and linear algebra. I like designing 2D/3D simulators, Plotly/PlotlyJS and matplotlib of equation and concepts. I am now keen to apply my knowledge of these in real life applications.

                I am a strong beliver of the importance of data visualization an, 3D modeling and UI/UX. I believe it is almost as important as the technical part. It manifest ideas, also it makes sharing points and knowledge easier, thus, aside from my skills in SASS and Adobe designing tools. I am currently studying ThreeJS and D3js.
